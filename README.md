# EVNTR (working title)

**EVNTR** is an app created to interface with a Canon EOS digital camera. 
It's main purpose is to act as a photobooth that can be operated by people attending an event.
Removing the photographer from behind the camera, allowing them to roam freely around the event or facilitate shooting an event.

If you're interesting in reading the story behind why I created this, I wrote a little blog [entry]().
